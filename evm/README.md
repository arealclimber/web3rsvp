# Web3RSVP - Solidity Part

It's developed with WSL - Ubuntu and dependencies with npm (hardhat `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`) in the beginning, however, it's changed to `pnpm`.

## Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
